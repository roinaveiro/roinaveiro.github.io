Assistant Professor at [CUNEF University](https://www.cunef.edu/).
PhD in Machine Learning, Stats and Operations Research. Interested in all kinds of (applied) research.
My graduate research with [David RÃ­os Insua](https://www.icmat.es/drios) was in
security aspects of Machine Learning. I touched different topics such as
large scale Bayesian forecasting, Adversarial Machine Learning, game theory,
risk analysis... During my PhD, I have been a visting student at Duke University and the
Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences instutute (Durham, NC, USA).

Currently, in addition to expanding my PhD research, I also work in several applied projects in diverse areas such as:
materials desing, drug discovery, finance, ...
I am also a research scientist at [AItenea Biotech](https://aitenea.com/en/), a very promising
spin-off from the Spanish National Research Council.

Prior to my PhD, I took my undergrad in Physics at University of Salamanca,
and a Masters on Theoretical Physics at Complutense University of Madrid
