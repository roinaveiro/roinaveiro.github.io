I'm a Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/) working on designing innovative and adaptive clinical trials. Prior to joining Berry, I completed my PhD in [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/).

My graduate research with [Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [84.51&deg;](https://www.8451.com/) was on large scale Bayesian forecasting in the context of consumer sales forecasting. My research touched upon topics in forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!

From 2011 to 2015, I attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I received my BS in Mathematics and was a member of the Dean's Scholars.
