#I’m a posdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.icmat.es/es) (ICMAT, Spanish National Research Council) in Madrid.

PhD in Stats and Operations Research. Interested in all kinds of (applied) research.
My graduate research with [David Ríos Insua](https://www.icmat.es/drios) was in
security aspects of Machine Learning (aka stats). I touched different topics such as
large scale Bayesian forecasting, Adversarial Machine Learning, game theory,
risk analysis...

Prior to my PhD, I took my undergrad in Physics at University of Salamanca,
and a Masters on Theoretical Physics at Complutense University of Madrid.
