I’m a predoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.icmat.es/es) (ICMAT, Spanish National Research Council) in Madrid.

My research focuses on applications of Machine Learning & Data Science and theoretical aspects that emerge from them.
In particular, I have been working on applications of Machine Learning in security and computational/theoretical aspects of Adversarial Machine Learning.

I'm doing my PhD under the supervision of [David Ríos Insua](https://www.icmat.es/drios) (ICMAT, Royal Academy of Sciences) and [David Gómez-Ullate](http://datalab.uca.es/team/david/) (University of Cádiz). Previously, I took my undergrad in Physics at University of Salamanca, and a Masters on Theoretical Physics at Complutense University of Madrid.
